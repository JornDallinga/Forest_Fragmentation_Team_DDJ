To DO list:

- Hansen et al data downloading should be overwritten when a different country is assessed. Because the read function reads the Hansen_GFC2013_gain etc arguments. And not the tiles

- Create plots for each location and each year for every index
- Create hansen et al 2012 forest cover map
Done

- fix bug from sexton et al when project is changed
Done
