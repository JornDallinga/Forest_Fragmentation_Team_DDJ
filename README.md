The forest fragmentation script

The script creates a random point in a selected country, creates a buffer and extracts the forest cover of that location.
The script compares two data sets of forest cover based on data of Sexton and Hansen.
The output creates one example buffer and compares the fragmentation and forest cover between the areas.
The output also creates a scatterplot between the nr. of forest patches in both data sets.
